            <h3>'21st Century Pop Icon'</h3>
            <p>
              BTS ( <strong>Bangtan Sonyeondan</strong>, Korean: “Bulletproof
              Boy Scouts” or “Bangtan Boys”), which debuted in 2013 and swept
              domestic and international rookie awards, has grown into the top
              boy group representing Korea in name and reality. BTS is causing a
              worldwide craze and is called a '21st century pop icon.'
            </p>
            <p>
              It has topped the world's leading charts, including the US
              Billboard, UK Official Charts, Japan's Oricon, iTunes, Spotify,
              and Apple Music, and is setting unrivaled records in album sales,
              music video views, and SNS indices. In particular, BTS is the
              first group to conquer the top of the Billboard 'Hot 100' chart
              and the "Billboard 200" chart simultaneously in one week, and has
              topped the 'Billboard 200' five times and the 'Hot 100' four times
              in total. In addition, he became the first Korean singer to
              perform solo at the '3rd Grammy Awards', setting a record of
              performing on stage at three major American music award
              ceremonies, including the 'Billboard Music Awards', 'American
              Music Awards', and 'Grammy Awards'.
            </p>
            <p>
              BTS has solidified its position as a global artist in the global
              concert market by holding a stadium tour, and is practicing good
              influence through UN speeches and the LOVE MYSELF campaign.

              Hi! My name is Tanja and I'm from Germany. I love BTS music and I

              I listen to their music or watch their videos.
